## Required Data for This Repository
We have prepared and provided the necessary data to execute the notebooks. The Smeaheia 2D profile is readily accessible in the designated folder. As for the Volve dataset, it requires manual downloading ([here](https://kaust.sharepoint.com/sites/M365_Deepwave_Documents/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=zW1A6n&cid=3dbd65e0%2D16cb%2D4c64%2Dac85%2D6202340b0428&RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FM365%5FDeepwave%5FDocuments%2FShared%20Documents%2FRestricted%20Area%2FDW0018%2FVolve2D&FolderCTID=0x0120009F9BE65BA42D194BBEFB62CBD730AF6A)).
